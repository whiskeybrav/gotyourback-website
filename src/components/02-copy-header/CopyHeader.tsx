			2020 was a challenging year. Whiskey bravo is committed to recognizing the United States Military who got our back 24/7 regardless of circumstance. Who has #gotyourback? Take a moment to recognize those youâ€™re grateful for. Show them the strength they provide you by doing 5 pushups with an object on your back and nominating 3 people to keep the chain of gratitude going. Post on social with #gotyourback and tag @whiskeybrav
